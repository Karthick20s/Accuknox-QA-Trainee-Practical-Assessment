# Task1 -  successfully containerized and deployment of the Wisecow
application to the Kubernetes environment with an automated CI/CD pipeline and
secured with TLS communication.

# Task2  - Developed a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. 
It should check CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of
these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the
script should send an alert to the console or a log file.

# Task3 - Developed a script that can check the uptime of an application 
and determine if it is functioning correctly or not. The script must accurately
assess the application's status by checking HTTP status codes. It should be
able to detect if the application is 'up', meaning it is functioning correctly, or
'down', indicating that it is unavailable or not responding.
